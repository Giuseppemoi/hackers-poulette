## The mission

The company _Hackers Poulette â„¢_ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build
your own. They want to allow their users to contact their support team. Your
mission is to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in *PHP*. 
It must *display a contact form* and *process the received answer* (sanitize, validate, answer the user).

There is a low-fidelity mock-up of the project:
